# Zane - Portfolio
Website to exhibit projects I have created and/or contributed to.

## Preface

This is my portfolio website that I am currently (actually from time to time, got a alot going on) working on. Along with my GitHub profile, it will host my projects that I have created. It it far from being completed, I created this repository for version control.

## Contributing

It would be greatly appreciated if anyone would like to contribute or even tips that would help with quality. I am learning back-end development, so CSS and JS aren't exacly my strong suits. I am still learning!
